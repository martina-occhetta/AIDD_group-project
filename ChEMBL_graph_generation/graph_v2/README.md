# AML Drug-Assay-Target-Disease Mapping and Analysis

This repository contains a collection of files that map the relationships between drugs, assays, targets, and diseases with a focus on Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). It includes a Jupyter notebook for visualizing these relationships using graph theory, as well as CSV files ranking various entities based on centrality measures in the graph.

## Contents

- `AML_drugs_assay_target_disease_mapped_relationship_tidy_non_wide_used.csv`: A CSV file that maps the relationships between AML-focused drugs, assays, targets, and diseases.

- `chEMBL_graph2.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to create and visualize a graph from the CSV file, focusing on the relationships between AML drugs, assays, targets, and diseases.

- `ranked_betweenness_sg.csv`: Ranked entities based on betweenness centrality in a subgraph generated by removing the large `not AML cell lines' assay cluster node.

- `ranked_betweenness_v3.csv`: Ranked entities based on betweenness centrality in version 3 of the graph analysis.

- `ranked_closeness_sg.csv`: Ranked entities based on closeness centrality in a subgraph generated by removing the large `not AML cell lines' assay cluster node.

- `ranked_closeness_v3.csv`: Ranked entities based on closeness centrality in version 3 of the graph analysis.

- `ranked_degree_sg.csv`: Ranked entities based on degree centrality in a subgraph generated by removing the large `not AML cell lines' assay cluster node.

- `ranked_degree_v3.csv`: Ranked entities based on degree centrality in version 3 of the graph analysis.


## Usage

1. To explore the mapping and relationships, start with the `chEMBL_graph2.ipynb` Jupyter notebook. It requires `pandas` and `networkx` libraries for processing the data and constructing the graph.

2. The CSV files provide pre-calculated centrality measures for entities within the graph. These can be used for further analysis or to guide research and decision-making processes related to AML drug development.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- `pandas` library
- `networkx` library
- `matplotlib` library
- `tqdm` method from `tqdm` library

Ensure you have the required software and libraries installed before attempting to run the Jupyter notebook.
